WIHA would like to thank every one of you for a great 2020. 
While the year was a turbulent one, we did manage to play a lot of hockey and had many new players join us on the ice!
After taking a few weeks off to enjoy the holidays, we are excited to share the details for 2021 - 
We have two seasons scheduled for 2021.
Season 1: March - June
Season 2: August - November ( exact dates tbc )
Jerseys: This year WIHA are ensuring we have complete sets of jerseys for each team which
will be handed out at the start of the season, with players responsible for returning or replacing
them at the conclusion of the season.
Cost: The early-bird fee to play in either division is $300 for players who register by February 15th.
For players registering after February 15th, fees will be $345. All players playing in either division
must also be registered members of WIHA.
