description: >-
  This is an exciting time for Wellington sport because the recent construction
  of a permanent ice rink has marked the birth of competitive ice hockey in
  Wellington. 


  **Current plan/schedule**


  There are currently ice hockey trainings for beginners that are run by a Coach that previously played in the New Zealand National Ice Hockey League as well as Canadian Coaches. The current trainings include skills training, followed by casual game play.


  These training sessions run at 4.30pm every Sunday at the ice rink located at 85 Port Road in Seaview.


  **TRIALS:** There are no trials at this stage, just sign up and come along for a go. Gear can be hired at the ice rink for those that want to test it out


  **COST:** The registration form is just a registration of interest, costs associated with the sport are listed below and paid directly to the venue


  **GEAR**: see the drop down menu above for more detail


  Things to consider


  * Cost: Ice hockey requires a lot of equipment and ice-time (trainings and games) will need to be paid for ($15 per session). The following page details what gear is required to play ice hockey at a competitive level, where to buy the gear, and the estimated cost (for the cheapest equipment).

  * Safety: Ice hockey has a reputation for being a rough sport, however, it is relatively safe due to all the equipment that players are required to wear. Furthermore, it is rare to have leagues in New Zealand that have ‘full contact’, or ‘checking’; only top New Zealand leagues allow full contact, so it will not be permitted in any Wellington ice hockey for the foreseeable future.

  * Travel: The ice rink is located in Seaview, Lower Hutt.
