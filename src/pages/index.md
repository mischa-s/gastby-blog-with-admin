    With the incorporation of Wellington Ice Hockey Association, October 9 has become a date worth etching into the history books of New Zealand ice hockey.\

    That date has come after many long days and nights of hard work by those involved, driven solely by their passion for the game and their want to see it succeed.


    Starting in 2016 with a square patch of ice in Lower Hutt, they have now transformed the ‘Frosty Spot’ into a fully functional rink with zamboni included. With these recent developments it is now more realistic than ever to envision competitive ice hockey as a reality for the capital, rather than a pipe dream.


    The hunger for having ice hockey in Wellington is there – we regularly field questions from fans about when the NZIHL could expand to include a sixth team.
